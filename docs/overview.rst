Installation
============

The recommended way to install this package is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install Composer
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php


.. code-block:: php

    composer require keppler/url

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at `getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.
